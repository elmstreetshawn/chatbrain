  <strong>The first AI chat system that actually remembers your conversations and learns from them.</strong><br>
  Built for Ollama, powered by semantic similarity, enhanced by user feedback.
</p>

⚡ What Makes This Special?
Ever asked an AI the same question twice? Semantic Chat Cache solves this by:

🧠 Remembers Everything - Stores all conversations with vector embeddings
⚡ Instant Responses - Returns cached answers for similar questions (0.2s vs 3s+)
🎯 Gets Smarter - Learns from your feedback to improve caching decisions
🔒 100% Private - Everything stays on your machine
🎨 Beautiful GUI - Modern interface with real-time feedback
🚀 Auto-Setup - Installs Ollama, downloads models, configures everything

</p>

🚀 Quick Start
Windows

Download SemanticChatCache-Windows.exe from Releases
Double-click to run
App auto-installs Ollama and downloads a model
Start chatting! 🎉

macOS

Download SemanticChatCache-macOS.app from Releases
Right-click → "Open" (bypass security warning)
Everything else is automatic ✨

Linux

Download SemanticChatCache-Linux from Releases
chmod +x SemanticChatCache-Linux && ./SemanticChatCache-Linux
Ready to go! 🐧


💡 How It Works
mermaidgraph LR
    A[User Question] --> B{Similar in Cache?}
    B -->|Yes 95%+| C[💾 Return Cached Response]
    B -->|No| D[🤖 Ask Ollama LLM]
    D --> E[📊 Store + Learn]
    C --> F[👍👎 User Feedback]
    F --> E

Question Asked → System embeds your question into vector space
Semantic Search → FAISS finds similar previous questions
Smart Decision → ML model decides whether to use cache or get fresh response
User Feedback → You rate the response quality, system learns
Continuous Improvement → Gets better at knowing when to cache vs. when to ask fresh

Result: Your AI feels instant for common questions while staying accurate for new ones.

🛠 Technical Architecture

Embeddings: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dim vectors)
Vector Search: FAISS with cosine similarity
Storage: SQLite for conversations + feedback
LLM Backend: Ollama (supports 70+ models)
GUI: Tkinter with modern dark theme
ML Pipeline: Hybrid rule-based + feedback learning

Key Components:
python# Core semantic caching logic
similarity = cosine_similarity(new_question, cached_questions)
if similarity > 0.95 and user_feedback_positive:
    return cached_response  # Instant!
else:
    return fresh_llm_response  # When needed

📊 Features
✅ Smart Caching

Vector similarity matching with configurable thresholds
Rule-based + ML hybrid decision system
Learns from user feedback (👍👎 ratings)
Handles variations: "How to lose weight?" = "Ways to drop pounds?"

✅ Privacy First

Zero cloud dependencies - everything local
No telemetry, tracking, or data collection
Your conversations never leave your machine
Perfect for sensitive/personal questions

✅ Developer Friendly

Clean, documented Python codebase
Modular architecture for easy extension
SQLite backend for data portability
REST API endpoints (coming soon)

✅ Production Ready

Handles thousands of conversations
Graceful error handling and recovery
Cross-platform compatibility
Automatic model management


🎮 Usage Examples
Perfect for:

Research - Ask similar questions, get instant cached results
Learning - Build up knowledge base over time
Coding - Remember solutions to similar programming problems
Personal Assistant - Recurring questions about health, finance, etc.
Team Knowledge - Share cached conversations across team

Power User Tips:

Use fresh [question] to force new LLM response
Type status to see training progress and cache stats
Rate responses to improve future caching decisions
Export conversations for backup/sharing


🔧 Advanced Installation
From Source:
bashgit clone https://github.com/elmstreetshawn/semantic-chat-cache.git
cd semantic-chat-cache
pip install -r requirements.txt
python semantic_chat_gui.py
Docker:
bashdocker run -p 8080:8080 elmstreetshawn/semantic-chat-cache
Customization:

Models: Swap Ollama models via settings
Embeddings: Use different sentence-transformer models
Thresholds: Adjust similarity cutoffs
Storage: Point to different SQLite databases


📈 Roadmap

 API Server - REST endpoints for integration
 Model Marketplace - Easy model switching UI
 Cloud Sync - Optional encrypted backup
 Team Features - Shared knowledge bases
 Plugin System - Custom caching strategies
 Mobile App - iOS/Android companions
 RAG Integration - Document knowledge bases
 Voice Interface - Speech-to-text integration
